I'm a recently engaged, hardworking professional in my mid-20's who is trying to start a new life with my partner, but several roadblocks have come up along the way.  I have always been a very honest, do-it-myself kind of person. Growing up in a lower middle class family, I worked and supported myself all throughout high school and college.   I currently work as a program director at a nonprofit organization that provides clinical, legal, and shelter services to domestic violence victims. It is a salaried position with full benefits (but the salary is at a typical nonprofit level). My partner is an artist/illustrator. We both work very hard and do not have a lavish lifestyle at all. We've tried to be frugal and save, but my partner recently had some legal, automobile, and medical costs to pay for which wiped out our savings.  My partner has sold the car, I have taken on a freelance job in addition to my full-time job, and now we are looking to move to a cheaper apartment as well as eventually get married. A loan of $10,000 would allow us to pay the last month's rent on the current apartment, pay for the security/first/last on a new, more affordable apartment, pay for moving expenses (we do not have much furniture or possessions), pay off my partner's legal and medical expenses, and maybe set aside some for our new life together.  I'm not proud to be requesting money from strangers because I've always tried to work my way through life and figure things out, but the situation has just become so tough and desperate with the fact I need to support my partner, and I would do anything for us to have a life together. Moving to a cheaper apartment and paying off the unexpected legal, automobile, and medical expenses will allow us to better manage our income and get back on our feet, and our top priority would be paying back this loan.  Also, I'm not quite sure how this process works as I've never done it before, but we currently live in New York but I was originally based in New Jersey, so that is why my location indicates New Jersey (we may also end up moving to New Jersey due to the more affordable rent).

I am a successful software engineer with 10 years experience, 5 in a big corporation, 5 as a consultant.

Most collection agencies boast of a 30%-60% return by simply sending out intimidating letters and phone calls. They are simply too large of an operation and have too many accounts to file suit on all of them. By purchasing smaller batches of debts and going through the full legal process, I am able to receive a return of 60%-90% with almost no office expenses.

A women's clothing boutique is being sold close to where we live.  This is a great location as it is across the street from a middle school and sandwiched between a brand new neighborhood and a developing neighborhood.  It is being sold because the seller has 2 other businesses and is unable to grow & manage this boutique to achieve profitability quicker.  Though there will be seller financing, a down payment is expected and we will need some extra money to act as a buffer for intangibles.  The Good: We tend to quickly increase profitability by lowering some of the overhead costs.  We intend to sell retail as well as act as a broker for those looking to make high end specialty purchases.  We will develop the website so that it will serve as a social networking site that will allow us to take input from shoppers who are looking for unique fashions.  Items will be sold on the site, and overstock items will be directed to overseas markets.  We intend to keep inventories fairly low.  My income is sufficient to cover extra problems that may arise.  My wife is not working and will manage & grow the business full time.  The Bad: This is retail and it may not be profitable for at least 6 months (thats not your problem though....).  The customer base is undeveloped and we will need to do a significant amount of marketing to build it.  This should not be too big a problem though as my wife is a recent MBA grad.  The Ugly: I'm in grad school and my loans will come calling by the end of summer in 08.  Since my last personal loan I have not defaulted or been late with any payments, but I have gotten more credit cards and have increased my available balances on all of them very recently; this may be a why it has gone down.  Also, I've gone from W2 employee to 1099 contractor (no taxes hoooray!), the uncertainty of self employment may have altered the grade as well.

I trust you will find this to be a unique, and quite interesting, so I thank you for your support. My business is APK Developments, LLC, which started in 2002 to develop advanced shift systems for the motorsports market. These are semi-automatic shift systems for motorcycles, race cars which use sequential transmissions. In recent years, this has been a booming market due to advancements in manufacturing techniques which have made sequential transmissions more affordable, increasing their demand, and the demand for shift systems to extract the full potential of a sequential setup. The purpose of this loan is capital for the numerous R&D projects current, file for patents, manufacturing add-ons, and brand building.   My current position: I work a day job, so this is done on the side, and has been treated as a hobby so far. This past year I took the next step to make this into something and funded heavily in setting up a place of business, as seen in the above photos. A couple years ago, the MS-100 was developed, which is the fastest air shift system on the market for drag motorcycles. Last year, the MS-120 quick shifter was introduced, which is the only system on the market for motorcycles that automatically adjusts each shift, so that each shift, is at it's optimum. This is one of the things to be patented. Currently, plug and play kits are being developed for popular bikes to provide the customer with a simple installation. Market indications for the MS-120 are great, as there are people waiting for plug and play kits to be available for their bike, however, I can not supply the demand without the needed manufacturing add-ons. Note that a number of these customers have been waiting for months, when they could have gone with the lower priced competitors products. This speaks volumes for my product, which is made to the highest standards.  What's in R&D? A market I didn't forsee with these shift systems is that of mobility aids. I regularly get requests for a system to be developed to up and downshift a motorcycle for disabled riders. This niche would allow injured riders (the primary request) to get back on a bike. I have found one company that produces a viable system, however it is primitive, and I have heard of many comments on it's bulkiness. Everyone requesting me to develop a system compliment the quality present in my products, and hope to see the same in a system designed for this niche. This challenge in R&D has resulted in a system in development, that will need a number of patents filed.  Secondly, is that of the race car market. With paddle shift systems gaining in popularity, there is a need for more cost effective systems for the middle levels of motorsports. For the lower levels (amatuer), higher quality systems at an affordable price.   As for brand building: The website is being completely redesigned (almost done). The company logo has been updated. A marketing plan is in place, and needs to be executed. This is initially done by sponsoring motorcycle racers for the coming season, which is an investment in itself.

Our income did not match it after it got beyond us and we ended up in debt.  We went to Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University and ended up even leading a class helping others to get out of debt and live debt-free as we are in the middle of doing.    We have had NO credit cards (we stopped using them long ago and then cut them up).  We work two jobs each bringing in now around $90K a year.  We live on a budget and cash envelope system.  We make timely payments always on our things (as my credit report will show).  Our credit rating is 720 even after all this. We have added $0 to our debt in the same time period as well!  Though our debt is larger than that we have been paying on, with this loan we would pay off at least one high-interest credit card (we already cut up long ago) and much of a smaller Home Equity loan.  This would bring our number of loans to pay off debt down to two eventually, have a lower interest rate over all, and lower monthly payment - also it would enable us to possibly be in a position to pay off more rapidly the remaining balance on the Home Equity loan.    We have lived on budget, faith, hard work for a year and we are going to kill the debt as we remain on this path.

My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.    The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we want to undertake a few small projects.  First, we need to purchase and install a new air conditioner before the summer, as the old unit is too small to cool the house adequately in the summer (apparently the prior owners only lived in the home during the winter months).    Second, there is an exterior golf cart garage that the prior owners enclosed to use as a storage area.  However, the construction was not done properly, and the drywall they used has become moldy and needs to be replaced.  Also, the foundation of the garage is below grade and needs to be repoured so that it does not accumulate water.  Finally, there are a few minor household projects we would like to undertake, such as installing some lighting and improving the airflow for our air conditioner/heater.    I would like to obtain a loan through Lending Club as opposed to disturbing our existing HELOC (which we took out at the same time we obtained our initial mortgage) because the HELOC contains a significant prepayment penalty.  We have explored other options such as financing the air conditioner through the installer, but the interest rates are too high for our liking.

I traded profitably for 3 years, and never blew up my account.  Only one of my 3 years showed a net loss (very small one at that) and the other two showed moderate profits.  The technicals -------------------- - My credit score, according to Transunion (Dec 8, 2007) is 784.  - I have a home - Bank owns 80%, I own 20% in equity so far, and I'm gaining on them!  Unlike some poor folks who are now upside down in their mortgages I bought in 2002 and have seen handsome appreciation in my area, despite sub-prime crisis.  I've felt the effects but its not as pronounced here. - I am 37, professional software engineer at a Chicago software company - I traded part time for 3 years, and intend to continue this endeavor once I am fully capitalized again.   - I do not trade derivatives at this time (futures/options).  I trade strictly in equities at this time, and don't plan on using derivaties at this time.  I think futures, especially, are too risky for a part-timer, or even an under-prepared full-timer, so I'm staying completely away from them for the forseeable future. - Net assets (including 401K which is considered a non-liquid asset due to taxation on it) is about $130,000.  And thats a conservative estimate.  My 401K comprises about $110,000 of that. - My monthly take-home from salary is about $4800 - I have one credit card with a balance on it, much of that debt is 0%, and almost half carries a 9.9% rate.  - I am an INTj  Any questions, feel free to ask.

I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.

Networks,5 years,RENT,53307,not verified,8-Feb,"Purpose of loan:   In a random audit, the IRS has informed me that when I was partially self-employed and doing my taxes in 2002 and 2003, I did them quite wrong. They would now like to reward me by telling me to pay them an additional $10,000 to $14,000 in back taxes, fees and penalties. (Total amount not yet confirmed, any excess received from loan would be paid back on loan.) While they may be able to offer me an installment plan, they warned me quite strongly that paying by installment will rack up much heavier penalties and interest.   My Financial Situation:   I am well employed at a position I have held for over 5 years. My yearly gross salary in 2007 was $53,307. My current FICO scores are: TransUnion - 760, Equifax - 741, Experian - 726.     Current Debt:    I currently have only one major debt in $30,000 spread over two student loans, but they are at low interest and the monthly payment is quite low. I also have several small credit cards opened solely for the purpose of improving my credit rating and used sparingly only for that purpose and are paid off monthly. Lastly, I have a Prosper loan with a $4000 balance remaining from another peer-to-peer lending network for previous debt consolidation, which I have never missed a payment on.   Negative Credit Information:     You will note in my credit information it shows a bunch of old late payments. These are solely from an old, paid off student loan. (Not the other one I am still paying on - it has no late payments.) I have no other late payments on any account.     Monthly NET Income: $2,799.74  Monthly expenses: $1683.00     (Costs are low because I split in half with partner/roommate. However, income would cover full bills in emergency with careful budgeting.)    Housing: $387  Insurance: $12 (Rental) Car expenses: $24 (Bus Pass) Utilities: $80  Phone, cable, internet: $80  Food, entertainment: $450  Clothing, household expenses: $50 Credit cards and other loans: $500 (Primarily previous Prosper Loan & student loans) Other expenses: $100     Expenses I don't have: Car payments or car insurance (I ride the bus). Health insurance 100% paid by employer.     Remaining monthly funds: $1117  These remaining funds have been previously split between voluntary contributions to retirement plan and emergency savings funds. This remaining money would be partially reallocated to paying new Prosper loan. I currently have an emergency savings fund of $6500 which I prefer to not use for this tax bill as I believe it is important to have a savings fund in case of an emergency such as injury or illness.     In Conclusion:    I am a solid investment who has never been late on their previous Prosper loan. I am not borrowing for frivolous reasons, risky business ventures or to pay something I could not pay otherwise in a different manner. I am asking for this loan in order to save money on penalties, fees and interest I would otherwise have to pay on the IRS back taxes that would be more in the long term than the interest I would pay through a peer-to-peer loan. I believe this is a sound financial move after careful and intensive consideration. I also far prefer to support the peer-to-peer lending system than be a slave to the IRS.     If you have any questions or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

But before I lived in Vail and Denver I attended college at Northern Michigan University and while I was thereI racked up a pretty high credit card balance. I am here in an attempt to consolidate my credit cards into one loan with a reasonable interest rate. Right now I'm dealing with a credit counseling agency that is charging $30 a month on top of the $400 payment I'm making each month to them. So in total I have a payment of $430. The payment is split up between Discover Card and  Chase Master card. In the two years I have been using them I have never missed a payment and have brought down the balances on my credit cards about 35%. I now would like to get a loan to stop paying the extra $30 a month and have a set term for when I will be done paying off the debt.

The other investment is in a health and nutrition company that would yield immediate profit from selling products.  My parent have an auto laon that is under my name. This is because their credit is bad and wanted a lower APR. They make payment for this each and every month. I also have a rental property that I owe with my sister and brother. We split all payments equally and set aside in a seperate bank account. The total is about $200 monthly after rent is collected.   I am an excellent candidate because I have great credit history and payment for the last 7 years when I first established credit. My fico score is 736 on Equifax. My cost of living is going to change dramatically. I will be moving back with my family to once again help them out.

I am planning to get married this fall and we both hope to be debt free before then, so we will be able to start saving for a house.  If I am get a loan, I will be forever greatful and hope one day not far from now to be in the position to help someone else who needs a hand.

LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in ""context"" for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollar�۪s ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who read��_ well I won�۪t digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!

Forgive a long explanation, but I want to give a complete picture to those who consider loans individually.   The past:  I bought my home with a very low-down-payment loan. It's a two-family with good rental income ($1150) in a good location ��� walking distance to midtown-direct train to NY.  The loan terms were not favorable looking out a few years, but I expected to be able to refinance my way out before it got bad. I was working as an IT manager and my credit record was steadily improving. Unfortunately, my company's parent company sold us, and I was laid off in the process.   I took a chance and tried to go into private consulting with a partner. Without going into detail, the partnership didn't work - we hardly made money. We broke up, and I was left with his share of six months' expenses, which I had covered.  I also had to deal with the eviction of a bad tenant and the associated financial pain.  Meanwhile, my $300k 1st mortgage rate climbed to 8%, nearly as high as my equity loan ($33k at 9%). I focused on keeping the mortgage payments current, which meant I made some hard (bad?) decisions to get by, including running up credit card debt, delaying payments, and becoming late on my property taxes (which were not escrowed.)  Of course, I also went back to work in the corporate world as an IT Manager.   Now, the present.  I have been 1.5 years working as an IT Manager in Manhattan ��� I'm in a stable position with a good firm and salary. I got current and then paid down tens of thousands in debt, starting with the highest rate, intending to improve my credit score while establishing a current salary history so I could refinance.  I just recently entered an arrangement with my 1st mortgage holder, who adjusted the rate to 5.5% fixed for 5 years (variable after) and covered the back taxes. They also paid my taxes forward 12 months, resulting in a $29k escrow deficit.  Then I set about getting an equity loan for $62k to cover the existing $33k loan and the $29k escrow deficit. It is not a good time for equity loans!  Banks have raised equity requirements, and have raised FICO requirements for high LTV loans. Though my score has risen to the 700 range, they want 740 for very high LTV. At the same time, my appraisal has come back lower than expected. I'm not worried about the current value ��� I plan to stay here for many years. But it does mean that it's simply impossible to refinance the equity loan now.  This leaves me with three alternatives.  1. Payment program with my 1st mortgage holder where the $29k deficit is paid back over 12 monthly payments. I can do this, but it would be a financial stretch, and I would expect to end the 12 months with \more credit card debt.  2. Refinance the entire home. In the current market, this means high fees and many points just to get a rate of 7%. While this lowers my monthly payments, the terms are so bad that I'd rather deal with the first option.  3. Get a personal loan to help spread the $29k out over more than 12 months, bringing me here.  This $24k loan will be used to pay off the bulk of the $29k escrow deficit - the deficit to be spread out over the next 12 months as an addition to my normal escrow payments.  I expect to be able to pay off my remaining credit card while paying off the escrow deficit. After that, my plan is to:  1. Pay down my Lending Club loan aggressively.  2. Max out my FSA and 401k contributions.  3. Become a lender with Lending Club, bringing me full cycle from borrower to lender.

I went to several banks for a business start-up loan, but to no avail. To get the business up and started, I had to resort to credit cards to provide the capital to get the business going.  I had as many as 12 players in the academy in the fall. Due to economic hardship for parents of a couple of the players and injuries, I have dropped to a current level of five players with five more to start the fall of 2008. In the mean time, losing those players who began last fall has cost me almost $25,000 in revenue for Spring 2008. Despite that loss, I have averaged almost $7000 of gross revenue per month over the past three months. With the higher interst rates, I would like to pay off the four cards with a balance of $23,575 with a consolidated loan, thus lowering my monthly payment and reducing the amount of cost to the start-up of the company.   I have a base salary of $35,000 from the facility that I am based out of and had commissions paid in the amount of $6600 in January and $9000 in February.

I reside and work in San Diego, CA.  I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.   CLOSING REMARKS TO LENDERS:  Thank you for taking the time to review my loan application.  With the assistance of this loan, I will be able to further establish a steady ground for my financial stability and future growth.

Currently I'm a waiter at a very nice upscale restaurant in Palo Alto with extremely consistent business. I'm looking to consolidate my higher rate interest credit cards into one easy monthly payment.  I've recently had to run up a few credit cards to pay for medical expenses (new baby) and moving as well. Also I have some outstanding balances on credit cards that I've managed to keep at 0% for awhile but now those interest rates are ready to sky rocket. I'd rather pay individuals interest than a large corporation. You need it more than they do!  Now is the best time to invest your money in individuals like me and others seeking to consolidate debt on lending club! I'm trustworthy and with a wife and two kids it's in my best interest to keep my credit good and make my payments on time! I would never default on you because I am very grateful for your help.

Lending and credit services are provided to individuals who do not have cash resources or access to credit to meet short term cash needs.The pawn shop will also provide services to people who are unable (or unwilling) to do business with commercial banks. Pawn shop will offer non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property such as jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods, musical instruments, etc.   An average loan is small, usually  $75-$100 at an interest rate of 15% per month (180 % APR) The pawn shop will hold the merchandise for  60-90 days, giving the borrower time to repay the loan amount plus interest. Statistically, 15-20% of pawn shops customers do not repay the loan, which allows the pawn shop to generate additional profit (In Addition To The Interest Charges) from the items resale. Since the loan amount is based on 30% of the items market value, defaulted loans can be one of the shops biggest profit generators. A typical loan at a pawn shop is for $75.00 and is secured by a household item worth $200.00. If the loan is not repaid within 30 days the pawn shop gets to keep the item. With the on line auction site E-Bay, disposition of unclaimed loan merchandise is quite easy and profitable.  Additional revenue soures for the ship are: Check cashing for people to cash checks who do not have a bank. Purchasing gold and jewelry outright from people (gold is trading at an all time high, which has a lot of people selling their old rings and jewelry).

I am moving into the house at the end of May and want to have the basement finished by the end of the summer.  I'm a math professor, which means that I can work from home some in the summer and have more flexibility with my schedule than I can during the fall and spring semesters.  Thus, I'm trying hard to get this taken care of this summer.  I'm single, and I prefer to have housemates instead of living alone.  I posted an ad on Craigslist looking for other young professionals with whom to share.  It seems that there are a lot of us who prefer to share housing, and I have had a lot of interest.  Thus, after I finish the basement, I plan to rent it to other young professionals.  My calculations indicate that this investment will pay for itself in about 4 years.   Of course, it will also increase the value of the home.  About me:  I finished graduate school a year ago, with a Ph.D. in math.  I'm now a math professor, which means that I do research in mathematics and teach math courses to undergraduates.  I am heavily involved in the mathematical education of teachers.  I like to teach math classes designed for those who are trying to become teachers, as well as professional development or master's courses for those who are already practicing teachers.  I'm currently a math professor in the south.  I'm a post-doc, which is a temporary 1-3 year position that you get after your degree to give you more experience so that you can get a permanent position.  It worked.  I will be starting a permanent (tenure track) position in Colorado this summer.  I want to settle permanently in Colorado, and I hope that I will work at this same University until I retire.

In the past I have been able to handle the stresses of working and going to school, but I graduate at the end of the year and I just found out a few days ago that I would need to complete three more classes this summer in order to graduate on time. This is very distressing news, because I work every single day during the summer months to pay for the following semester. I would like to graduate on time, it has been a very long six years and I want to be the first person in my family to have a college degree.  I do not want to push my graduation off any further.  I plan to graduate with a BA in Spanish History/Interrupter Education. I would like to be an Interrupter and also a Spanish Language Arts teacher after I graduate. Spanish language and learning about other countries has been a wonderful experience. I love learning about other cultures and studying this language has taught me so much about how other people live and how learning a new language has brought down so many barriers. So far I have not had a chance to travel oversees, but I plan to do so after my graduation.  I love attending school and I have been able to pay all of my education expenses so far, but these three classes will be a strain on me financially.  I want to be able to complete and pay for these three classes and always pay for the following semester and graduation fees.  Hopefully with this loan I can pay all of my school bills and not have to work part time so I can focus on my education and graduate on time and begin a new life and my new career.

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.  I want to get this monkey off my back ASAP, and a lower rate loan would enable my to get financially fit much, much faster.

After reading Suze Orman's book, I learned that this is the one time it is o.k. to accumulate credit card debt.  During the first few months alone, I was not making rent in a bi-monthly paycheck.  Since then, my business has picked up and I've branched into other areas of the industry.  The biggest venture was becoming a Stott Certified Pilates Instructor.  The cost  of the certification added to my debt with the understanding that I would be able to start taking clients after all the trainings.  My income is now doing better with the exception of having to pay well over the minimum payment due just to keep the balance moving downward toward complete payoff.  Unfortunately, the debt has seemed to be on a standstill for a while now.  My sister has had her debt on here and recommended that it was a better option to pay off the accumulated charges.  As a young professional, I knew it would be tough to pay off the debt without adding more charges.  It's a vicious cycle that seems to go nowhere.  Having Pilates as a third source of income has been helping with my bill payments, but  is still overwhelming at this time.  It would be a huge help to have one steady payment each month, instead of fluctuating minimum balance payments.

Rather than just replacing the head with the stock engine internals, I plan on purchasing a fully custom built motor which will cost approximatley $5,000 to $6,500 depending on the options.  This will also help increase the value of the car and provide more longevity.  The car is so rare that since I purchased it in 2005, it's value has only depreciated $2000.  I am willing to use it as collateral if necessary.  Also, on my credit report there is one delinquent account for like $120, which I am in the process of trying to resolve right now.  It was from an AT&T wireless bill from like 2000/2001 which I settled and just popped up with a collection agency.  I called AT&T and they can't even find the account in their systems.

My business has reached the Platinum Powerseller level on eBay and my sales are ranked in the top 5 of all sellers on eBay that offer similar products. With this loan I intend to expand my product selection.  The business model I have implemented on eBay is one that has allowed me to develop a niche market amongst other bead sellers. The type of beads I sell are sold by color and weight. The typical business sells these beads in a package that requires a minimum amount of each color. This can cause a customer to be forced to purchase much more than they would typically need to finish a project. For example, a crafter wants to make a pair of earrings that has 10 different colors in it. If they were to purchase the beads needed from the typical seller, they would need a package of each of the 10 colors which could cost anywhere from $3-$5 or more each. And at the end, they would have a lot more of each color than was actually required to finish the project.  I cater to the crafters who are out to save a few dollars and only want to purchase what they actually need. I offer all my beads in small quantities, allowing the crafter to tailor their order to match the project. Over the years I have received numerous complements from my customers, as well as wonderful repeat and referral business.

I had a full ride for academics as an undergraduate student; however, my Father was the sole provider in our family and he was laid off during my sophomore year of college.  He was no longer able to pay for my books and living expenses such as groceries.  In order to finish out my junior and senior year of college I had to go into credit card debt.  Upon graduating it took me three months to find a job- during which I defaulted on my credit cards.  After securing a job by the end of that summer (2004)- I have never missed a payment or been late.  However, due to the high interest rates (20% in some cases) it has been difficult to get these debts paid off quickly.  I am hoping to get a lower interest loan- that is only 1 payment instead of the 4 that I am currently making- in order to pay these debts off as quickly as possible.

At this point, I would like to minimize my interest rate fees in order to contribute more to the principal.Furthermore, I have closed the credit cards that I plan to pay with this loan, which are listed in  my credit report.

This boat is the one that gives the company the best return, and we can't afford to have it down.  The motor pictured blew up following a salvage of it when a customer ran the motor into a dock and knocked the motor off of the boat.

BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company.

We received 0% interest for the first 6 months, and have been paying $216 a month since June. The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan ""B"" was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan ""C"" is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan ""C"".  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit and have never missed or been late on a payment in almost 20 years of borrowing. I have a stable, secure, decent paying job.

Unfortunately, my ���D�۝ credit rating is a result of difficulties  during those years of  the divorce & relocation.  I have made steady fiscal progress with each passing year.  My last big hurtle to reaching my goal of financial freedom is eliminating lingering bad debt.  No longer do I utilize credit cards to live!  When I moved to my current state of residence I accepted a state government job for $9.00/hr and no benefits in hopes of ���making something happen�۪ with my life.  Within two months I had a position on the regular payroll with benefits and have progressed from that entry level position into a management position.

Presently I am paying a mortgage and assisting my husband with our mutual debt and repayment of  my old closed accounts which we took out a loan for 2 years ago. This loan is scheduled to be paid off by April 2009. Each month we sit down and pay the bills and we see no progress, other than just keeping current.

This loan will provide me the opportunity to further my education, consolidate some of my indebtedness and advance my career and income.   I'm extremely excited about my decision to accomplish my long awaited dream of obtaining my Masters degree in Psychology and Counseling.  Although I joyfully taught in the public school system for 23 years, my desire was always to be of greater service.  Most recently, I have practiced as a licensed Real Estate Associate Broker in Colorado.   Suddenly I have found myself divorced, financially challenged and responsible to a large degree for the care nurturing and well-being of my beloved 9 year old granddaughter.  Being of sound mind and spirit, I'm well aware that NOW is the time to take action, move forward in positive directions and create a bright future for myself and my little one.   As my teaching license expired in 2005, My immediate goal is to begin my Masters Program and reinstate my teaching license after completion of my first 6 semester hours, which will enable me to substitute teach while continuing my education.  As the opportunity arises I will also sell homes and vacant land to supplement my income while attending school.  Realizing that my requested loan amount may fall a bit short of financing my entire Masters, I am confident that I will be able to secure scholarships or grants to complete my degree program.  I hope to graduate within 18 months of enrolling.   Upon completion of my degree, my intent is to be employed as a school counselor within the public school system or practice family counseling with a private counseling service provider, thus increasing my income and ability to repay this essential loan.   In the long-term, my fondest wish is to establish a very special ranch, in my mountain home area, which will provide unique opportunities for handicapped children and adults alike, as well as services, facilities and respites for families in need.

The $6,000 loan will be used to perform an initial market study on the site (which will be completed by Maxfield Research Inc).  The market study will be used to determine the following:  �ۢ Analysis of the 55+ population and households by 5-year age group; �ۢ Analysis of household incomes of the 55; �ۢ Analysis of household tenure (owner, renter); �ۢ Analysis of home values in the Jackson, Mississippi area and the ability of households age 55 and over to sell their homes within a reasonable period of time and for what value; �ۢ Completion of an inventory of competitive senior housing products in the draw area; �ۢ Information on any pending senior developments that may have an impact on new senior housing products that would be developed; �ۢ Calculations of demand for various senior housing products; �ۢ Preliminary conclusions based on the findings.  If the initial market study reveals sufficient potential demand for additional senior products, then our next step would be to conduct a more in-depth Full Market Feasibility Study (which would require another loan of nearly $7,500 & would also be conducted by Maxfield Research).

When we first started planning, we decided that we wanted to wake up the day after our wedding having paid for it entirely, without any debt.  After analyzing our finances, we realized we needed a little help to reach our goal.  Our parents graciously volunteered to contribute $10,000 to our wedding.  However, as a result of the recent tumble of the stock market and housing markets, our parents are no longer able to help us pay for our wedding.    We don't want to cancel the wedding, as we've already paid $3,000 in deposits, and have friends and family who have already purchased plane tickets.  We decided instead to cut the guest list and trim back the menu, cut out luxuries like an open bar and fancy flower arrangements, and have reneogitated our contract with the venue and caterer.  As a result, we have managed to scale back our budget by 25%.    There are still some things that we really do not want to cut out, such as paying my grandmother's hotel and airfare so she can attend, as she wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise, and helping our parents with their plane tickets.    We plan to allocate $4,500 to actual expenses, and reserve $1,500 for emergencies.  Any cash we do not use will be paid back immediately.

RTO is a business model that leases vehicles to individuals with poor credit.  If the customer stays current for the entire contract, the title is transferred to their name. The customer has the option of returning the vehicle at any time, the ability to swap to other vehicles as their needs change, and other similar flexibility.   Vehicles are purchased at dealer-only wholesale auto auctions. The average wholesale price on each vehicle is approximately $1,500-$2,500. Whenever possible, vehicles require either major transmission or engine repair, which improves profitability even more. All repairs are performed at cost by our sister companies that specialize in transmission and engine repair. We have a rollback we use to transport such vehicles.  The requested amount will allow us to obtain between 8-9 vehicles. The average down payment per vehicle is $500, with typical monthly payments of $360 and average contract length of 36 months. Assuming 8 vehicles, total down payments should equal approximately $4,000. These vehicles will generate approximately $2800 of monthly revenue for 36 months. Industry averages suggest that approximately 75% of RTO customers return their vehicles before their contracts expire, thus exponentially increasing revenue potential per vehicle.  Although the business model is similar to the proven BHPH (buy here, pay here) business model, there are many unique advantages, especially in today's economy.   * The title of the vehicle remains in the company's name, which makes repossession paperwork unnecessary.  * If the customer doesn't return the vehicle, it is a criminal offense and the vehicle is reported as stolen. * Unlike BHPH, since we own the vehicles, bankruptcies of customers have no effect on our ability to retrieve vehicles. * Since this is a lease, and not vehicle financing, rental agreements are not subject to usury laws. * Customers are required to have comprehensive insurance with us as the lien holder. We also have a sophisticated umbrella insurance that monitors each customer's insurance on our behalf.  Each vehicle is secured with a GPS device that can locate and disable a vehicle if necessary. With these devices, industry reports insignificant delinquency, repossession, and skip rates. Any necessary repairs or maintenance are referred to our sister companies, and performed at actual part and labor costs. When RTO vehicles are out of warranty, customers must pay for any required repairs, or optionally, return the vehicle ��� thus, allowing us to restart the billing process with a new customer.  The demand for our services is expected to grow exponentially. As the economy hits challenges, those unfortunate that must file bankruptcy have little choice in obtaining reliable transportation. Our customers are thrilled with the service we provide and frequently refer us to their friends and family. Because our sister companies perform automotive repair, we are flexible on mechanical issues when they arise, ensuring customer perceived value.   My financial situation: It is important to note that our company already has several hundred-thousand dollars of available floor planning funds. However, the fees and costs involved are quite expensive. For example, there is a monthly floor planning fee of $45 per vehicle per month. Annualized on a $2000 vehicle, the floor planning fee alone is approximately 30% - and that doesn't include interest, repayment of principle, and other miscellaneous fees. Obtaining funds from lendingclub.com would be a win-win for us and the lenders - by saving us money and allowing lenders a higher than average return.   I personally have excellent credit, have never filed bankruptcy, have no non-business debt other than my home, and own two other auto repair franchises free and clear.

I'm currently consulting on various small businesses that are taking their business online to maximize their sales.  ABOUT STARTUPSNAX:  StartupSnax.com, the provider of Daily Munchables for  Your Business, is a small business resource site centered around providing current and edgy content for the web 2.0/social media & networking entrepreneurial environment and to help anyone looking for a current site to find information on how to start their business cost-effectively (how about under $10,000?), time-efficiently (maybe in a matter of weeks?) and resourcefully (how do I make sure my business is green?).  WHAT DO WE OFFER?  With the resources of the industries keynote authors on various topics, we will be offering:  - StartupSnax Blog - StartupSnax Free Stuff! - StartupSnax Ebook Store - StartupSnax RSS Feed and Newsletter  The authors of these ebooks are major industry writers that will be using their current substantial sales platforms (their websites, speaking engagements, newsletters, radio events, online blogs and webinars, book signings, and various other PR opportunities, etc) to direct traffic towards our site in addition to our online marketing, SEO and online traffic efforts. They will be using the site as a marketing vehicle for their various works and expertise.   HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?  Ebooks:  Ebooks have been increasing in YTD (past year to date) sales more than any other product in the publishing industry! Publishers Weekly (www.PublishersWeekly.com) has been quoting that although various in-store sales have been down over previous YTD sales, ebooks have been continuing to increase with the lowest overhead and highest profit margins! Better yet, trade ebook sales (business, not fiction) have been doing well despite the hardcopies' decrease in sales due to the economic slump.  Fortunately, since we are only offering these professionally-edited, written and designed ebooks in digital format, we are saving the cost of printing them, and staying GREEN as well!  By offering smaller (snackable!) ebooks in a condensed format by major authors similar to the Cliff Notes for small business and offering these ebooks at an impressive price point of less than $10, by maximizing traffic, we are sure of substantial ebook sales numbers based upon industry trends.   Ad Sales:  We have not calculated the inevitable ad revenue that will be garnered from providing a pivotal ebook store and resource site into our breakeven analysis but it is a buffer to ensure that we are profitable in the first two months.  WHY DO YOU NEED A LOAN?  A loan is a buffer for guaranteed success. Each person and company should have an emergency fund of at least three months' worth of working capital especially in this economy. Although we could  launch without a loan, although difficult, we are ensuring the success of a solid business plan in the case of a substantial interest in the company at the launch and the need for fast growth.  My credit is exceptional and this is not my only form of income since I'm also consulting, but I always advise my clients that cash is king! In the effort to keep the marketing budget at its peak, I need a loan to ensure those efforts. Also, the ebooks are being professionally copyedited and designed for ideal quality and I'm utilizing an industry leader as a production editor.  WHAT CAN I SEE NOW?  You can view the parked page at www.StartupSnax.com.  Our blog goes live mid November with a final site launch slated for January 1st!

I joined the credit counciling service because the interest rates on my credit cards were really high and I was paying a lot of interest and very little on principal.  I have never missed a payment or made a late payment before or after joining the credit counciling service.  I know it will take a little longer to pay off my debt by getting a personal loan, but at least my credit score will not be so low.

My volunteer services are very important to me.  In the forefront is my work with Senior Citizens followed closely by my work with the Chicago AIDS Foundation.

Well, Puck now has two winter sweaters, a small cow bell so I can locate him when he runs off into the bushes at the dog park, and I have heard myself utter the phrase ""come to mommy"" more time than ""sit"" ""stay"" or ""bad boy.""   I decided to add more about myself to try to flesh out who it is asking for a loan.  I always pay my bills and simply want to start moving forward in my personal quest for home ownership.

I am obtaining this loan to assist in paying down my auto loan so I can sell the vehicle.  I now have a company car with my job so my personal vehicle is no longer needed.  Unfortunately, when I bought the vehicle last year, I rolled over about $6,000 in negative equity from my previous car.  The vehicle I purchased is a Dodge Nitro (SUV) and as unfortunate as it is, domestic vehicles don't hold value at all (especially with gas consuming SUV's) and it has quite a few miles on it for being as new as it is since I drove it for work with my previous company.  Needless to say, I won't get the full KBB value for the vehicle.     I own a home and have a very good paying job.  My base salary is $77,500 and my bonus each month is between $2,500 - $6,500 (never less than $2,500) with an annual income well over $100,000.  My mortgage is $2,000 but it is split evenly with my fiancee' and have very minimal credit card debt.   Most of the credit card debt I have is because I front the money for my company (expenses such as lunch and dinner with clients, gas, etc) and am reimbursed for it at the beginning of the month.  The personal credit card debt I currently have is for purchases for the house since I bought it last year and I pay it off every month for the most part.      I have a buyer for the car now, I just need to pay down the loan when we complete the transaction so the pink slip can transfer between lenders.  I am selling the vehicle for $12,500 and I owe $24,500 on it.  I need to fix the quarter panel on the vehicle which will cost about $2,500 from a hit and run accident I was a victim of.  Once I sell the car, I will get out of my car payment as well as the insurance.    My expenses will be as follows:  $1,000 mortgage $600 - this loan $150 - Student Loan $500 - miscellaneous expenses  I take home over $4500 a month or so for the most part so this is well within my budget.

The judge agreed.  My ex has since demobilized, but has elected to make Missouri her permanent home.  That means there's been a material change in circumstance, so I've filed a motion to secure an enduring custody & visitation agreement.

My specialties include the maintenance of computer networks, internet access, and email systems; software and hardware troubleshooting; data backups; and data recovery from damaged hard drives.  I also utilize the latest technology for remote troubleshooting and can take control of client computers within seconds of a request.

For the last five years I have been going solo and have been too busy to take on new customers, but an opportunity has presented itself to take on someone with whom I�۪ve worked in the past who has the perfect technical expertise.  Toward this end I�۪ve just purchased another cargo van (that I will turn into a mobile information technology center) and I�۪d started to buy equipment using some special-rate credit card offers when I realized that���as silly as this may sound, as I just signed up to be a lender���I can borrow at a better rate over a longer period of time from LendingClub.com.

We all had to forego an annual bonus which I depended on to pay off the debt I accrued. I am hoping that next year will be better and that I would receive a bonus and payoff this loan.  I am a single parent of 2 children, one who is a Junior in college and will someday be taking care of her mother! :)  I would truly appreciate it if someone would be willing to take a chance on me.

I have spent the last 14 months working exhaustively on  the R&D (research and development) of my brand's products, testing, designing and developing an innovative/functional line  for a broad demographic of women (ages 18- 50) I have produced an initial line of 30 products: Slimming/Bodyshaping lingerie and garments ie: tank tops + dresses(these pieces can literally can take up to 4 sizes off of a woman) Panties with removable padding, completely backless bra's, tag and bra strap ""tamers"", carbon filtered inserts for underwear, bra stap converters and comfort straps, portable lint packs and magic erasers for deodorant or spill marks, double sided body and fashion tape, invisible panties, a secret pocket for bras etc...   HUSH will be every girls best kept secret and Hollywood Stylists brand of choice for all of their clients red carpet needs. This company is my baby. I spent 5 years in NYC (my hometown) working in the entertainment industry in both Public Relations and Publishing. I've developed strong relationships with publicists and Editors at Magazines and have amassed an enormous contact list of over 800k clients waiting for HUSH's 2009 launch. These are REAL women who are ready and waiting to buy HUSH as soon as it launches. I have also built relationships with buyers at Saks, Bloomies and Neiman Marcus, as well as boutique stores in Miami, NY and L.A. who have pre-ordered inventory. HUSH will also be sold in the international market where there is huge demand and little competition.   Additionally,  I am currently building the HUSH e-commerce website www.shopHUSH.com. I have made it a point to fund my business with personal capital and not by incurring debt and up until this point have been successful. However, the demand for these products has exceeded my initial expectations (not the worst problem to have) and I am seeking this loan to cover a small portion of my upfront manufacturing/delivery costs. My business is one of the few that is seemingly insulated from the current economic downturn. History and studies show that women tend to spend more, rather than less, on vanity and beauty items during a recession.   I work with reliable manufacturers in both Asia and Colombia, South America and can supply more information about them if wanted. The margins on my products are good, typically 4:1.

I had never intended to fund this trip with a loan--I had been planning this trip for almost 3 years and had been saving up for it.    Unfortunately, the increased cost of living this summer forced me to dip into my savings.  I had to move into a cheaper apartment within my budget and adjust my living expenses accordingly.  In doing so I had used up a significant portion of my savings.  I am now living comfortably and within my budget, but I cannot afford to join my friends on this trip which is this month!   I have had a steady job for four years and I make enough in order to pay off this loan in less than 3 months.  This trip is coming at a time when I am just rebuilding my savings, and so without this loan I cannot not afford to go on my dream vacation.   Thank you for your time and consideration.

I'm am currently shooting two feature length independent films.  These films are not being shot on High Definition, but all subsequent films will need to be.  Therefore, I must upgrade my camera to HD, as well. The camera I've chosen allows for interchangeable lenses.  Having this camera will bring me more assignments due to the camera's versatility, ability to shoot using cinemagraphic lenses and my practical experience with the feature films that I have worked on already.   I base this on the fact that I noted an increase in business when I upgraded in 2005 to a camera that was capable of shooting 23.98 frames-per-second.     Being able to offer shooting-plus-editing packages to clients at reasonable rates is a strength in the current economic environment.

I've gone from 10-20 minute projects (documentary, promo's, PSA's, ads, music videos) to feature length indie film and DVD projects. These projects require more processing speed and hard drive space than the Mac G4 I've been using can handle.

I am currently seeking a loan for my business. This loan will be used to consolidate a high interest credit card and to make final payments on two 2008 pre-season merchandise invoices.      I have owned and operated this growing adventure sports business for over 18 years. The business has been located on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe for that entire time. We carry Hobie, Wilderness Systems, Perception Kayaks, sailboats and stand-up paddleboards etc half of the year and then we add winter gear skis, snow shoes and soft goods for the second half of the year. This growing business consists of a retail store front location on the busiest intersection on the north shore. We also have an outdoor lake front space in back of shop that is next to public beach park for our kayak and sailboat rentals. There is not a better location on the lake for what we do. We also offer online sales. Our third quarter of 2008 was our best quarter to date with a net of 240,000.00. We sold more kayaks and sailboats than ever before and also increased our rentals and guided tour business.  One reason I seek this loan is to pay off the remaining kayak inventory. In the kayak world you must order pre-season to have boats in stock while ���in season�۝ estimating exactly how many you will need is impossible so we always carry some extras throughout the off season. This is also necessary in order to have off season sales (we sold three $800 kayaks last week).    I am a healthy 51 year old husband and father. I have been married for 27 years. I have two wonderful children ages 20 and 26. My wife is a special needs school teacher and I also have a part time job that pays me a salary of just over $500 a week. I can work the business during the day and work my salary job at night when I am needed. I can be trusted to pay back this loan in a timely consistent manner. My goal is to pay this loan back by the end of the summer. This business has grossed (in one day) $12,500.00 the amount of this loan request.

Because of the current economy 2 of my card issuers went back and reduced my available credit line to a lower amount. In doing so that put my credit balances and credit lines within a few hundred dollars, thus lowering my credit score. Three months later the card issuers came back and said that due to a periodic review of my credit report they were increasing my interest rate. One card went from 5.99% to 15.99%. Now did they do this because I was late on a payment? Or I went over my credit limit? Nope, none of the above - they said because my credit score dropped a few points. I guess the card issuers need to make all their rate increases now before the new law goes into effect in summer of 09. That law will protect consumers from these business practices and would have prevented them from raising the interest rate on the current balance and they would only raise the rate on future purchases.

In the past year and a half, my husband and I have paid off over $15,000 of credit card and auto debt that we slowly accrued while I was a stay-at-home mom. We were looking forward to paying the rest off by springtime, but both of our well-worn cars (over 230K miles each!) have bitten the dust within two weeks of each other. Except for a small emergency fund, all of our extra income has gone toward debt repayment, so we don�۪t have enough cash on hand to replace both cars at once. Standard auto loans require that the cars be 2003 or newer, and that we spend at least $7,500 on each���but that�۪s way more than we need or want to borrow! My credit score is excellent, so the interest rate they�۪ve offered is good, but I�۪m hoping to demonstrate for my kids some good old fashioned fiscal responsibility���by minimizing debt and working toward a more secure financial future. We�۪ve researched our local market, and have found that a $5000 loan-- combined with the cash we have-- will purchase two older but highly reliable cars that, if not too pretty, will get us through our daily work and school commutes safely and reliably.

That month my family was involved in a serious auto accident and my youngest brother suffered severe injuries resulting in multiple surgical procedures and lengthy hospital stays. Since the accident, additional facial reconstructive procedures have been performed and the total cost of the medical bills climbed well into the hundreds of thousand dollar range. Although insurance covered the vast majority of the medical costs, it did not pay for everything.  To make a long story short, by December 2007, I had accrued a substantial amount of credit card debt. However, in spite of these obstacles I have aggressively paid down the debt throughout 2008, and as of December I have eliminated more than $12,000 of the debt.      In August 2008, despite my payoff efforts Bank of America raised my interest rate from 7% to 25% and slashed my available credit to just above my balance because I was now categorized as high risk. I made numerous attempts to lower my interest rate but to no avail, and with the economy in its current state I have not been able to successfully transfer my balance to another account with a lower rate. So I am now looking at other sources to payoff the B of A card and its ridiculous interest rate.   I would like to convey to all considering my loan request that I am a sound investment and this truth is supported by the following facts: I have a secure career in the electric utility industry headed into its 7th year (have to keep the lights on!), I will earn a salary in the six figure range this year and beyond, and despite the recent adversities I am absolutely determined to payoff all debts while honoring my commitments.

I want to pay down my debt quicker, and a loan from LendingClub will help reduce my interest charges.   My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I am financially stable.  I have a well paying and stable career with the leading CTI company. I am currently paying all my loans on time and more than minimum payments, but I want to reduce the actual interest I am paying.   I haven't missed a payment with any of my lenders and my career is moving up steadily.   I have had credit history for 4 years and never missed a payment, but I guess that's not enough for the automated systems to validate my history.  As I've been on time and more than capable to pay my loans, I think that I have not been graded by capability to repay my loans, but simply because I have not had a long history of credit.

You may have heard that real-estate is suffering now because of the recession. This is currently true except for the location I work, Raleigh, NC. Raleigh is actually seeing steady growth while the rest of the countries home prices are still slipping. Things will stabilize later on this year but in the meantime I am looking to increase the size of my business in preparation for this influx by getting this loan. My marketing plans include a website with Neighborhood Monthly Market Reports, Lead Generation Software, a personal assistant, and a buyer's agent.      Those who spend money in a recession on their business see 200% profits afterward while those who don't only see 50% growth.   How will I repay?      I own three cash-flow properties, stocks, bonds, and have savings. This loan will give me the extra boost I need to see a successful year in real-estate.  I am a trustworthy individual with a Bachelor's degree in science and some grad school in a PhD program. I am dedicated and honest.

For all of this time we have been customers of Bank of America, with an exemplary record -- never late on anything, no bounced checks, perfect A++ rating. Last December, as a ""thank you"" for our quarter century of solid business, Bank of America cut our business credit. This left us without the ""bridge"" capital that we use for seasonal fluctuations in our business income.   Our contracts are usually enacted in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of each year. Therefore, around January each year, we have used our credit means to ""bridge"" operational costs and payments, to get to the next series of contracts. And that is the reason for this request.   It was as a result of a TV news story that I have decided to try this, to see if we can make it work. Although we are a small family company, in the last two tax years our company did a solid $157,000 and $148,000 in taxable revenue, respectively. We can fax or email you the tax returns as proof. The two principals both have excellent credit rating. I can also provide you with both FICA scores.  This small amount we are seeking will help us at a time when our company needs this ""bridge"". We can either pay it off incrementally, or in full upon the occasion of our next contract. Our last contract was worth $84,000, and the one we are now in the process of securing will be at least that much. This is one of four permanent clients, plus others as we make the sale.

Ninety percent of the capital received from will go towards the purchase of top tier computer hardware which will dramatically increase the speed at which I am able to analyze & execute orders on behalf of my clients.   In addition, I have already hired software engineers from several countries to create what might be some of the most dynamic trading software in the industry today. The remaining capital will go toward maintenance fee's of the software. Currently my software executes the trades based on the changes in the market trend along with several other proprietary factors. The trading software performs at the highest modeling quality level of 90%. This simple means that for every 10 trades I place in the Forex (Foreign Exchange) market 9 will not only result in a profit, but will reach its intended profit target.   To verify the performance of my robots, I am providing lenders access to my virtual sever account where live unmonitored trading is taking place.  Once inside you will have the ability to view the full performance of the robots over a 30 day trading period.  To receive immediate access please contact me to request access.    Return On Investment: I plan to successfully fulfill my loan commitment via my company management fee system. The Sovereign Wealth Company Management fees are a hybrid fee system based on traditional hedge funds. In turn for successfully trading each client's account the Sovereign Wealth Company receives 20% from profit made through each member's account. To some people who are used to investing in a far less dynamic market place, 20% per month on profits may seem a bit over the top, but when you factor in that the Sovereign Wealth Company could produce account increases of 10% to 40% per month it's all relative when compare to yearly fee's charged by money managers in other industries.   The profits from my company have been consistent and very accurate and I see no change in the near or distant future.

Of course, now that I'm 22, I've realized this was a terrible, terrible idea.  Over the years I've lived paycheck to paycheck, just paying off my credit cards.  I am fortunate that I never lost my job, and never paid a bill late.  In the past year, I've been promoted to Systems Administrator at my company, earning a much better living that I previously had.  I've been able to pay all of my bills early every month and, generally, make over $500 of over-payments.  This has been great, but I'm hoping to improve on it by consolidating all of my bills into a loan with an overall lower interest rate.  Here is an overview of my income and living expenses:  Salary Income: $2,750.00/mo (net)  Monthly Bills: Rent:  $395 (The remaining $500 is paid by my roommate and girlfriend of over 5 years.) Electric: $60 - $120 Internet Access: $49 Auto Insurance:  $166 Cell Phone (Family Plan): $175  *Personal Loan: $271 (This was used to consolidate even higher interest debt!) Auto Loan: $239  *Amazon Visa:  $16 *Chase Visa:  $18 *Best Buy Card:  $50 Bank Visa:  $10 *WaMu Visa:  $99 *CapitalOne Visa:  $16  * = Eliminated by new loan.  Overall, $1584 in expenses each month.  This leaves me with $1,166 each month for gas, food, entertainment, etc.  I try to live minimally to maximize over-payments and savings.  Each month $470 goes to unsecured debt.  Here is a breakdown of the approximate balances and interest rates of the debt I would be paying off with this loan:  Personal Loan    $6,600   18.2% Amazon Visa       $940      12.4% Chase Visa         $1,100   19.4% Best Buy Card    $1,700    19.0% WaMu Visa         $2,600    19.9% CapitalOne Visa  $440       12.0%  Total: $13,380  As you can see, not all of the interest rates are terrible, but I would like to eliminate all of my revolving, unsecured debt into one loan which can be paid automatically.  I do have an additional credit card with a balance of $460, but I will not be consolidating it, as it has a rate of 7.2%.  Please help me accelerate my dreams of living a debt-free life!

BUT, they were more than willing to offer me a ""great deal"" where they would give me another credit card at a low interest rate!!  I refused and when I did the research, I discovered that this was a new tactic being used where the higher interest credit card account would have been closed and opening another account would have adversely affected my credit score (thus further indebting me to that bank)!!!!  This offer occurred when my credit score improved as the collections accounts from 2001 were no longer on my credit report......It is important to note that one of my bank card holders raised my credit limit at a time when banks were lowering credit limits and the bank that raised my APR, never lowered my credit limit......I'm not a high risk, I'm a cash cow and enslaved to the BIG Banks!!

The gym will currently consist solely on the use of the gym and will offer Yoga and Pilates in the near future. Esther is registered to become a certified Yoga instructor mid-2009. According to City-Data.com (2009) the population of Belfair is over 6 thousand residents. Grapeview/Allyn also has a population of more than 2 thousand residents. The location, which is along highway 3 across from the Safeway store and next to the Kitsap bank, is the main thoroughfare to Bremerton for north-Mason Residents. The current facility has 72 individuals on a monthly payment plan to use the services. The only facility in the area is the one in place and has not allowed new members in several months. We will use advertising on the building, which is highly visible from the main thoroughfare of highway 3. The organization will also be referred clients from the sole local Physical therapy in Belfair, Belfair Physical therapy. Once the completion of the physical therapy is complete, Belfair Physical Therapy will recommend a membership at the establishment. We will also receive referrals from Abel Wellness, which is also located in the building to be used. 	The monthly price will be approximately $30 a month for the gym and $50 a month for access to the yoga and Pilates along with the gym. The current expected fixed cost is $5100 a month and will need approximately 170 members to break even. There are currently 72 members, therefore, only 100 more are needed to break even. 	Our Plan is for either Esther or Bradley to occupy the business during business hours and use an access control system for the after business hours.

I̢���m currently employed at a gym where I sell memberships, a job I̢���ve done since last December after getting out of school.  I̢���m a hard worker, and I̢���m usually one of the top performers in the Austin area (out of six clubs).  Unfortunately, my job only pays me enough to get by and never enough to get ahead.  Overall, I̢���ve enjoyed the gym experience for the most part, but there are a few things that I̢���ve learned from working in a corporate environment.  First, I̢���ve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss.  I don̢���t have a problem with authority or following directions, but sometimes I feel that I̢���m not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use.  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college, I̢���ve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there (at least from an investment perspective).  As long as I work there, I̢���ll always be trading my hours for dollars, building a business for someone else.  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future.  I want to build a business that works for me, to be able to make money even when I̢���m asleep.  At any rate, I am looking to get involved in real estate investing.  I̢���m not looking to quit my gym job, but rather build wealth part-time until I̢���m in a position to leave.  I know that real estate investing is risky, but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach.  To be effective in real estate, though, I need a small amount of start-up capital.  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation, desire, and talent to make money, but I don't have the financial means to get the ball rolling.  That's all I need.  I just need a chance. I hate having debt, and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be.  However, I̢���m willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead.  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt.  I still maintained a 3.4 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus.  I feel I'm responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures.  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background, I am taking Dave Ramsey̢���s Financial Peace University course.  In case you̢���re not familiar, his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative, and he teaches using a zero-based monthly cash flow plan where ̢����every dollar is spent before the month begins.̢���  So for me, I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account.  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people.  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours (so I can spend more time on real estate).  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions.  I have a plan and I'm confident in my ability to execute. Needless to say, I'm very motivated to make money, get out of debt, and start enjoying my life.  This loan would give me the chance to change a lot of things for my life.

As a result, during this period, I opened a couple of credit cards and recently established relationships with credit unions. As I�۪m lacking tangible ���installment�۝ loan history��_this loan will result in a more attractive credit portfolio for future potential lenders and allow me to keep my rainy-day savings in my brokerage account.  SAVING MONEY��_  With the purchase of this home, my mortgage payments will be significantly less than my current rent and comparable rents for the area. The condo is much closer to work and public transportation is easily accessible. Money for auto maintenance, cost of vehicle wear and tear, fuel costs, insurance cost, and most importantly��_time will be saved with this purchase.   ���FREE�۝ RENT��_  My current rental payment track history obviously shows I�۪ll be able to more than meet my future mortgage obligation. However, after the home purchase, I will find a roommate to rent a bedroom. A roommate is not a necessity��_but the idea is a roommate will allow me to save and invest an additional $450 a month. The rent/utilities the roommate pays will almost completely satisfy my mortgage, tax, insurance, and HOA obligation. My living expenses will be close to zero.  SAFE BET��_  I have a secure job that pays a decent wage and pays my medical, dental, disability/life insurance, etc. As a result of my father�۪s advice to always pay cash, my DTI is very low. While I know my father would advise against this, I believe this loan will save me a significant amount of money in the long run.

This loan is to help my sister, who is a CPA and our parents own their own business.  Neither my sister or I work in the business and have our jobs based in another town.  For our parents business, we have only been listed as an officer and have signature authority on the bank account.  We do not handle any of the cash nor work in the business.  They got behind on their payroll taxes and owe money to the IRS.  In addition, my parents filed personal bankruptcy and the IRS is in the collection process for the payroll taxes.  Under the tax code, the IRS can hold any officer in the company that would have had the ability make payments liable for the payroll taxes.  Thus, the IRS is not only attempting to collect from the business and my parents, but also holding my sister personally liable due to her CPA license.  The impact of the IRS holding my sister liable is huge again because of her CPA license.  If she does not pay the tax, they will file a lien against her as well as revoke her ability to prepare tax returns.  If the IRS revokes that ability, the state can revoke her CPA license, which means that she not only loses her job but also her 1/3 ownership in her accounting firm.  If that happens, she will lose everything that she has worked over 15 years to build.  My sister is well-respected in her area for business advisory services, tax preparation and financial statements.  She LOVES her job and what she does and cannot imagine losing it.  She does not condone the actions of our parents and is caught in an unfortunate legal liability of which she had no control of.  We have attempted to get a business loan with her guarantee from the bank, but they also required a guarantee from the shareholders which was declined due to their bankruptcy.  She is unable to secure a loan personally to cover the full amount of the debt due to prior obligations.  Furthermore, she has resigned her position as an officer and asked to be removed from the bank account to avoid any future potential liability.  My sister is determined to keep her career which she has worked so hard to build and I am doing what I can to help her.

The salon grosses $6400 per month, and the net is about $2900 per month, which is $34,800 per year after rent and utilities. I would like to add more styling stations and equipment which will help to generate more net income.  I am also employed full time for the government and my salary is $48,000 per year. I bring home about $3900 per month after payroll deductions and taxes, but this amount does vary depending on how many hours I work, and overtime, etc.  I do not have any other expenses for the salon because the stylists which are independent contractors are responsible for purchasing their own items and supplies, etc.  The only monthly debt payments I have personally totals $340, excluding housing. Including my housing it is $1,099. I do not have any credit card debt, no collections, and no bankruptcies. Conventional banks do not help people that are in my unique situation. My business is a cash business, and I have not applied for a lot of credit accounts, and the banks look down on that. I do not have a lot of open credit accounts because I do not really believe in credit cards.  I like to pay cash if I have it and that way I avoid getting into debt. I have been very responsible with credit and do not like to just open up accounts for the heck of it. Apparently this is not something that banks like, because they are saying that I do not have a lot of credit accounts. I only have 3 but that is enough for me. They want people to open up so many accounts so that you can drown in debt, but I have steered clear of that scenario. Please help me further my business venture because banks are not willing to help someone with a unique situation like me even though I have good credit scores.

I also wish to increase my direct marketing through brochure and other mailings and e-marketing methods. In addition, I wish to expand my memberships in area chambers of commerce, the Better Business Bureau (who have offered me membership), sustainable building organizations and market related list services. 2.

I wish to improve my office facility. I need a new office sign, plus new office carpeting as well as lighting and furniture.  To put this request in context ? I am a registered architect and have been working in the field for 33 years, and in private practice for 20 years. This is the first time, in all that time, that I have sought a business loan. During that time, I always had an abundance of work, all through referrals. The thrust of my work has always been what is now referred to as Green (environmentally responsible) design. With the change in the economic landscape over the last two years, I have seen the need to improve my business, skills, and marketing to keep up with current market needs. The steps I?ve outlined above are in my mind critical to staying competitive. I am confident in my professional skills and wish to significantly expand the means by which I pursue delivering greater excellence to a wider clientele.

Unfortunately, the interest rates have skyrocketed and I just can't seem to be able to pay it down.  I always pay more than the minimum required but it does not seem to make a dent.  One credit card has a large balance and a very high interest rate and more than 1/2 of the monthly payment is wiped out by the interest rate fee.  Please help me stop this vicious cycle.  I am a responsible individual with good credit history, always pay on time and a stable job.

The restaurant has a website, but does not offer online orders. I will change the website so people in the area can also order online.  The restaurant has great reviews online already which should bring customers to the restaurant.  I will also increase the amount of advertising in local papers and distribute leaflets to attract more customers. I will update the menu and offer more food. This restaurant has a successful operation records and the place was established in 1986. The area is surrounded by really nice houses, many offices, a mall, and plenty of parking. I drove around and this is definitely a wealthy neighborhood and people can afford to eat out on a regular basis at a restaurant like this one.  Facilities: 2050 SF plus a full basement. The restaurant cans seats 65 in the dining room.   About me:  I graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in upstate New York (www.hws.edu) with a major in Economics and a minor in International Relations.  My educational background, personal experience and career interests has equipped me with the tools to run this business. It has always been my dream to own and run a business and this is a great starter place. I am confident that I can successfully bring this business to the next level. I am currently working as Legal Assistant at a large Financial Company. I am quite accomplished in dealing with a diverse group of individuals from a wide array of backgrounds.  My current salary can cover the loan in case the restaurant does not produce what I am projecting. ",small_business,Buy a small diner/Restaurant ,104xx,NY,16.58,0,Oct-00,1,45,,6,0,757,22.90%,11,f

Over the past year, with the assistance of the VA Vocational Rehabilitation program, I have invested over $100,000 in Operation: ROCK the HOUSE which is outlined below.  I did something similar while I was in the service in Germany.  Op: ROCK the HOUSE has a pretty tight timeline that doesn�۪t allow for intermittent delays (troops are returning everyday) like I have encountered in applying for a Patriot Express Loan. I am asking for $1,400 that will be used as working capital and operational expenses to continue the project until either my Patriot Express Loan or one of the other repayment scenarios comes through. 	 By investing so much, I ran up my credit cards to the point that my RLU has taken a toll on my standard 720 credit score.  Thus, a portion of this loan will be used to pay down the credit cards and improve my RLU.  Once I receive the Patriot Express Loan this loan will then be repaid in full. 	 The next several repayment scenarios involve the VA.  One, the VA VocRehab program reimburses me for the majority of my investment and this loan is paid off; two, the VA gets around to processing a VA disability claim I have in the neighborhood of $30,000 and this loan is paid off; or, three, and coincidentally the day my wife looks forward to the most, the VA finally processes another claim I have that amounts to roughly $75,000 in back-benefits and this loan is paid off.    Lastly, a large department store chain has asked to receive samples of our product line.  A portion of this loan will go toward having the samples manufactured.  The revenues from sells of the products will allow the loan to be serviced if not repaid entirely.  Of all the scenarios, this one is my favorite. 	 Thank you for your interest and hopefully your support.  Regardless, we look forward to seeing you during Op: ROCK the HOUSE.  Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is a ���Homecoming Celebration�۝ for service members by a service member. It lasts all summer long and is performed in three major acts. 	Act 1: May 5, 2009���Drop date. The release of a unique compilation CD, that has notable artists performing songs written by disabled Army veteran, Jet West.   	OBJECTIVE: A theme song and ���celebration soundtrack�۝ to provide a means of national identity, espirit de corps, and party music for a nation-wide celebration in honor of returning American troops.  	Act 2: May 23-25, Memorial Day Weekend���Short Shots Leg 2, Short Shots, occurs as people across America shoot short video clips for the homecoming music video.  	OBJECTIVE: Embody the spirit of rebirth in the nation as it brings about new hope with new promise for all generations and celebrate the American military members who keep it possible.  	Act 3: September 4-7, Labor Day Weekend���Trooptastic Finale Three days of concerts held simultaneously in three cities with performers rotating between cities.   	Active military and veterans admitted free with government-issued picture ID���available free through the VA. Ticket prices set in inverse proportion to corporate sponsorship. Seeded with sales of the CD. 	OBJECTIVE: A national event to honor and celebrate the work of the military men and women who keep us free. 	Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is the brain child of disabled Army veteran and former Soldier of the Year, Jet West. Jet West Music Group Ltd is getting its start through the VA VocRehab program with financing made possible by LendingClub.com, the SBA Patriot Express Loan Initiative for veterans and, of course,  the thousands of contributors to Operation: ROCK the HOUSE. Jet West Music Group intends to use proceeds from these events to expand the entertainment options of service members stationed around the world far into the future starting with shows for the service members who missed Operation: ROCK the HOUSE.

The 2-room ""new addition"" (built in 1913) risks falling on the neighbor's home. This is because our homes are on a steep hill and this section of my home sits above the neighbor's home.   [More about the project]   The contractor will remove weakened wood members joining this ""new"" addition to the main structure of the house. He will reinforce the addition by ""sistering"" the joists. He will also add additional reinforcement ties (to code) and will secure foundation footing.    [More about the house]   This Queen Anne-style home was built in 1891. It was the first private residence completed by a prominent local architect named T.J.Collins. His work is well-known in this part of the country. The home has not had proper care in over 20 years. Locally, it is a historic treasure that deserves repair.    I was approved for a total home renovation loan, but, that felt like too much debt all at once. Therefore, I'd like to repair and restore in smaller steps. This is the first step, and somewhat urgent.    [More about me, the borrower]   I work for a personal finance company. So, I am very aware of the responsibilities associated with borrowing money. I chose Lending Club because I can responsibly ""pay-as-I-go"" on this restoration project rather than take on too much additional debt at once. I maintain good credit.

Our next project is a custom deck of Bicycle cards, produced by the US Playing Card Company in Ohio.  Our deck has already gone through the stages of approval at USPCC.  We have self-funded the artwork/proof fee.  USPCC is ready to run our deck as soon as we have the funds.  The custom Bicycle deck market exploded in 2004 when ellusionist.com created their Black Tiger Deck, which has sold over 250,000 decks.  It has continued to grow with more offerings from Ellusionist, and other companies.  The market is still going strong.  In October of 2008, a company called Big Blind Media debuted a deck of cards, and the entire first printing sold out in a mere 2.5 weeks.  Their next deck will be on the market this spring.  Custom decks are sought after by card enthusiasts such as poker players and magicians, and there are many collectors of various Bicycle decks.

I would then use a Lending Club loan to pay of my current line of credit with the bank and pay down some of the vehicle loan.

All start up costs have been paid and loan is for capital to make additional loans. If you have read anything about the pawn shop industry you know business is booming. We find ourselves needing more capital to make additional loans - loans that are backed up with collateral that we hold at our shop. The collateral is extremely liquid and is worth a minimum of 165% of the amount we make the loan on. Our interest rate? 180% APR!!!.  56% of Americans live paycheck to paychedk. 20% of the United states population does not have a bank. Lending and credit services are provided to individuals who do not have cash resources or access to credit to meet short term cash needs.The pawn shop will also provide services to people who are unable (or unwilling) to do business with commercial banks. Pawn shop will offer non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property such as jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods, musical instruments, etc.  Our current loan average loan amount is $130.00 at an interest rate of 15% per month (180 % APR) The pawn shop will hold the merchandise for 60-90 days, giving the borrower time to repay the loan amount plus interest. Statistically, 15-20% of pawn shops customers do not repay the loan, which allows the pawn shop to generate additional profit (In Addition To The Interest Charges) from the items resale. Since the loan amount is based on 30% of the items market value, defaulted loans can be one of the shops biggest profit generators. A typical loan at a pawn shop is for $100.00 and is secured by a household item worth $200.00. If the loan is not repaid within 30 days the pawn shop gets to keep the item. With the on line auction site E-Bay, disposition of unclaimed loan merchandise is quite easy and profitable.  Additional revenue soures for the shop are:  Check cashing for people to cash checks who do not have a bank.  We purchase gold and jewelry outright from people (gold is trading at an all time high, which has a lot of people selling their old rings and jewelry). WE BUY GOLD!  We provide other financial services such as money orders, money transfers, tax preparation, prepaid phone cards, and Cricket prepaid phone plans.

The interest rates on my cards aren't that bad, as my credit score and history are excellent, but lately with the current financial tom-foolery going on I've been thinking a lot about our banking system.  I decided if someone is going to make a profit lending ME money, I'd rather it be real people rather than a bunch of rich fat-cat in a fancy office skimming off the top.  So, I'm collecting my credit card debt (the debt that I don't have at 3.9% fixed for the life of the balance) into one payment.  I take my debt very seriously, and have had revolving credit lines in good standing since I was 16 (a $300 balance capital one credit card!).  I have been with my current job since 1998.  My bills primarily consist of a car loan, and a few credit card bills.  My wife and I have housing paid for by our company (she works with me), so we have a very good debt to income ratio and put as much as we can into savings every month.    I've considered using our savings to pay down debt, but up until recently we were making more in investments than we were paying in interest.  We'll see what the future holds.  I'd pay off corporate debt before I'd pay off this LendingClub loan (which only has a three year term, which is a fairly insignificant amount of time in the big picture).

I am looking to reduce my interest rate and monthly payments and see the monthly progress of my debt repayment rather than being stuck in the same place month after month as a result of high finance charges and fees.   My current credit card debt is inhibiting my ability to successfully implement strategies to enable me to grow my company. I am married with a wife and 2 kids. I am honest and have always paid my bills on time. I just need a little help right now.   Now the details...  We are an IT consulting company working with small businesses in the San Diego area. I started the company in 2003 and now have a total of 3 employees. In order to grow to the next level, I have started working ON my business instead of IN my business. This has required me to reallocate my time and resources to develop a consistently profitable business model. While I have a viable customer base, I�۪ve had to reinvent myself and my company to accommodate the need to grow my company. The ���one man�۝ shop mentality and working on break fix issues will not allow my company to grow to the next level.  I have developed a profitable business model, which is based on recurring revenue. A tremendous benefit for my customer is the ability to budget their normally un-predictable computer/network costs. Using a flat fee, ���all you can eat�۝ support model paired with a software technology which enables me to provide 24/7/365 monitoring of all critical networking devices and remedy issues remotely. This allows me to have a consistent revenue stream for my company and benefits my customers by saving lost revenue due to unpredictable downtime.   In addition, we have created a state of the art Business Continuity Solution to prevent disasters of data. It�۪s also based on a recurring revenue model which provides customers the ability to keep working if their server(s) goes down for whatever reason.  Overall, my new business model is a proactive solution to managing a company�۪s IT infrastructure (computers, servers, router, etc��_) A typical ���computer�۝ company spends a lot of time and effort in a reactive break/fix model. We are able to proactively manage a computer network to prevent the problems before they become an issue.  The new business model includes a few different components:  1.	Marketing: Most business I�۪ve had has been word of mouth referral. I am now able to target customers who benefit from a proactive solution. This requires a comprehensive marketing strategy with multiple touch points from multi-step campaigns to lunch and learn seminars. To that end, I have hired a marketing expert who specializes in marketing for IT companies like mine. I now have 3 step marketing campaigns, tech tip postcards, and a wealth of other marketing material that will enable me to reach numerous new customers.  2.

I am going to exercise my option to buy, which is $21,400.  The car is in excellent condition, I have only put 16,000 miles on it.  Comparable 2006 Infiniti G35s at a dealership cost $24,000 - $26,500.    I plan to pay the Connecticut car taxes and fees in cash, put down approximately $4,000 of the price, and would like to finance the remainder.  I could put down substantially more in cash if I desired, however, I am saving for an engagement ring for my girlfriend, and the subsequent wedding of course.  Thus, paying off the $17,500 over three years will allow for a relatively small car payment and free up ample cash to have the ring by Fall, and then save for the wedding in Summer of 2011.  Financially, I am in very sound shape.  I am an attorney, currently working as an international tax and global restructuring senior associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP.  The firm, unlike its Big 4 counterparts, has announced it intends to weather the financial crisis without laying off employees.  Irrespective of this, I work in an area of tax law that is doing robust business due to pending proposed legislation involving multinational corporations.    I have been with PwC for over three years, and have consistently received the highest possible ratings during our year end review process.  I currently make $117,500 a year before bonuses.  My monthly take-home income, after 401(k) contributions, is approximately $7,000.     My main monthly expense is the approximately $2,600 I pay in home ownership cost (inclusive of insurance, condo fee, and utilities).  Otherwise I pay $350 in monthly student loans, and then for the basics (cable, cell phone, car insurance, gas, etc).  I have zero credit card debt.  My current lease payment is $516 a month, so the montly payment on the loan I am seeking would be more than this, but not substantially more.  That pretty much covers it.  I have a very secure job that pays well, and the reason I am looking to finance the purchase is so I can save for a ring and wedding over the next two years, while still having ample cash on hand to live life.

The group was started three years ago on meetup.com, and has now grown to over 900 members, its membership steadily increasing even with people joining and leaving every day. We have regular meetings at a local bookstore, where the average attendance is about 50 people at each official monthly meeting. We also hold photo outings and workshops in the interim between meetings, with an average of about 20 to 30 participants.  We're currently expanding our operations to include a fully functional social networking website, where members can log on, have their own page and portfolio space, talk on the forums, post events to the calendar, and patronize local businesses whom we've partnered with in exchange for a group discount on their services. We'll of course be selling adspace as well as using more innovative techniques for taking in revenue, such as hosting links to amazon.com for photography-related books and other such photography-related products and services.  We've already begun construction of the site, and we've already invested a fair amount into the group (around $2,000), which has yielded a great amount of success. However, to go further we'll need a relatively small loan of $3,000 to ensure the website's completion and full working order. The loan will also allow us to furnish the group with technological necessities (a dedicated computer and eventually a digital projector) which allow for the group to be regularly maintained and developed. The group's presence and success can be observed publicly at its current online location: photo.meetup.com/438, where anyone can see the number of members, previous meetings and their attendance, and the nearly unanimous praise for the group and its activities.  Having three years under our belt has taught us a great deal about how to interact with the community and how to provide a true service without charging for basic membership or normal activities. Our aim is to keep this model at all costs and to only charge for services and opportunities provided which are ""above and beyond"" the normal routines of the group and the corresponding benefit to its members. In this case, such ""above and beyond"" circumstances include participation in group showings at local galleries (which generally charge a utilization fee for us to use in the first place) as well as premium member account benefits on the website that's currently under construction (such as unlimited uploading of photos, fewer ads, etc.).  My own credit rating is reputable enough, as you can see, and I've never made a late payment. As an investor in this business, you can expect the same reliability in the returns you'll be provided with, given your interest and participation in this loan.
